- Setup some gleam.io functionality
	- This is a multi stage process as gleam giveaways provide lots of different entry methods
		- Functionality for entering with twitter follows has been implemented. Need to fully test
- Need to add infinite searching functionality. Currently takes a parameter in cmd line arguments or takes five results.
	Can be achieved with repetitive searches, perhaps using the result_type: recent parameter. This may mean that some of the bigger ones can be missed if not in the window.
- List out entered giveaways.
- Functionality for checking direct messages or own mentions in tweets. This is to do with how do I check if I have won. Assuming that if a giveaway is won, they will mention my handle in a tweet or send a direct message to get in contact.
- potential functionality for only entering giveaways that include keywords. (limit search to exact areas). Provide lists of keywords in different file
- Setup functionality for going to external links. How do we deal with different sites own forms?
- Need to time slice for gleam giveaways vs Follow/retweet/favourite giveaways. This is an issue due to getting the urls from the tweets and extended tweet_mode.
